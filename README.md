# 🧢 CTRL 404 – Streetwear Brand Practice Site

## 📖 Overview

This project is a mock e-commerce website built for a fictional streetwear brand called **CTRL 404**. I created this site as a way to practice modern web development concepts, layout design, and smooth user experience — while also experimenting with brand identity and clean, stylish presentation.

CTRL 404’s concept revolves around themes like digital rebellion, staying disconnected, and original style.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 13+ (App Router)**

- **CSS Modules**
- **Keen Slider (product carousel)**
- **Responsive Design (Media Queries)**
- **Smooth Scrolling + Scroll Snap**
- Optional: Swiper.js and other experiments

## 🎯 Purpose

I didn’t build this as a full business. It’s not hooked up to a backend, database, or real payment system — and that’s intentional.

> **This site was built as a creative and technical exercise.**

I wanted to:
- Practice clean, responsive layouts
- Explore interactive components like carousels and smooth scrolling
- Develop brand aesthetics (fonts, colors, logos)
- Get comfortable building UI for real products
- Show off frontend skills in a visually polished way

## 🚧 Notes

Some elements (like product images, newsletter forms, or cart buttons) are **placeholders**. The focus was on layout and UX rather than full functionality.


## 🧠 Future Ideas

- Add backend/API for real products
- Hook up Stripe or another checkout system
- Add product filtering, categories, and cart logic
- Launch limited drops
